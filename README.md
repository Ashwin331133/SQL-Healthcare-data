# SQL Queries for Health Care Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project contains SQL queries designed to analyze various aspects of health care data, focusing on flu shots, patient encounters, and hospital information. The queries provide insights into patient demographics, encounter costs, and flu shot statistics.

- **flu_shot**: Contains data on patients, including their race, county, and whether they received a flu shot in 2019.
- **flu_demo_data**: Includes patient information such as age, ethnicity, gender, and flu shot data for 2022.
- **Health_care_demo**: Details patient encounters, including encounter costs, organization details, and payer information.
- **Hospital_ER**: Records patient visits to different departments, including waiting times and demographic details.
